# HCA 35 Import Report

## Errors or other interesting tidbits I noticed while looking through the data

- Some notes
    - HCA 35, Volume 17, pages 230-241 ("Ceres") - some of the columns appear to be shifted wrongly. Needs a manual review.
- Courts that need another look - what do these mean?
    - 1 Bahamasone
    - 1 BahamasVice
    - 1 BahamasEnumeration
- Court cell that contains multiple courts, do we want to handle this?
    - 2 Cape of Good Hope, Havana, Jamaica, Sierra Leone
    - 2 Sierra Leone, Saint Helena
    - 1 Mauritus/ Cape of Good Hope
