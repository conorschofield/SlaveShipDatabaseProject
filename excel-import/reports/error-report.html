<h2
id="errors-or-other-interesting-tidbits-i-noticed-while-looking-through-the-data">Errors
or other interesting tidbits I noticed while looking through the
data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some notes
<ul>
<li>HCA 35, Volume 17, pages 230-241 (“Ceres”) - some of the columns
appear to be shifted wrongly. Needs a manual review.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Courts that need another look - what do these mean?
<ul>
<li>1 Bahamasone</li>
<li>1 BahamasVice</li>
<li>1 BahamasEnumeration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Court cell that contains multiple courts, do we want to handle this?
<ul>
<li>2 Cape of Good Hope, Havana, Jamaica, Sierra Leone</li>
<li>2 Sierra Leone, Saint Helena</li>
<li>1 Mauritus/ Cape of Good Hope</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="errors-detected-on-import">Errors detected on import</h2>
<ul>
<li>Transcription problem: validation failed for adjudication date
<ul>
<li>Location: row #12 of volume #80 in sheet “vol80” of workbook
“workbooks/HCA 35 Index Merged as Separate Sheets.xlsx”</li>
<li>Columns needing correction: Date of Adjudication</li>
<li>Explanation:
<ul>
<li>validation failure: year 18862 in date “February 26, 18862” is out
of range. Please re-check against the HCA 35 originals.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transcription problem: red number data loss
<ul>
<li>Location: row #66 of volume #71 in sheet “vol71” of workbook
“workbooks/HCA 35 Index Merged as Separate Sheets.xlsx”</li>
<li>Columns needing correction: Red Number</li>
<li>Explanation: Red number(s) is/are way too big! This usually means
that multiple red numbers were entered without space separation, or
Excel thought that it was a single big number. As a result, it has been
unpredicably rounded and truncated, causing unrecoverable data loss. Use
slashes to separate multiple red numbers instead of commas or
similar.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transcription problem: problematic adjudication date
<ul>
<li>Location: row #117 of volume #74 in sheet “vol74” of workbook
“workbooks/HCA 35 Index Merged as Separate Sheets.xlsx”</li>
<li>Columns needing correction: Date of Adjudication</li>
<li>Explanation: adjudication date was not a string and is almost
certainly wrong: 2022-02-11 00:00:00</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transcription problem: end page before start page
<ul>
<li>Location: row #49 of volume #1 in sheet “main” of workbook
“workbooks/HCA 35 Index Merged as Separate Sheets.xlsx”</li>
<li>Columns needing correction: Start Page, End Page</li>
<li>Explanation: End page 392 is before start page 393. This is probably
a typo.</li>

<li>Transcription problem: end page before start page
<ul>
<li>Location: row #53 of volume #1 in sheet “main” of workbook
“workbooks/HCA 35 Index Merged as Separate Sheets.xlsx”</li>
<li>Columns needing correction: Start Page, End Page</li>
<li>Explanation: End page 402 is before start page 407. This is probably
a typo.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transcription problem: assuming end page
<ul>
<li>Location: row #55 of volume #1 in sheet “main” of workbook
“workbooks/HCA 35 Index Merged as Separate Sheets.xlsx”</li>
<li>Columns needing correction: End Page</li>
<li>Explanation: The end page was not written, so it is assumed to be
same as the start page (408). It is best to state this explicitly
instead to avoid ambiguity.</li>
